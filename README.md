#Smart Doors
Work-in-progress
Doors containing VBL that can be opened and closed by macro.
Doors have various settings such as;
- swing/sliding door
- locked/unlocked
- swing arc
- can be peeked through
- can be paired to allow double doors

Currently only work properly when actioned by GM. This should be fixed with MT v1.8
