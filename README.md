# MapTool
Bits and pieces for the MapTool VTT

#Frameworks contains 
- SampleD20, a bare-bones framework for D&D 3.5e/D20 system.
- battletech-lite, a pretty comprehensive implementation of Battletech.

#Drop-ins
- characterEditor.mtmacset, a few macros that make a simple character editor
- lib_SRD35Monsters, info/database token for all the monsters from the 3.5e SRD
- lib_chosenOne\*, a replacement for the built-in pop-up stat-sheet with customisation and other configurable functionality.
- lib_charSheet\*, a powerful generic character sheet frame with lots of configurability.
\* These two work on their own but they are also designed to work together.
